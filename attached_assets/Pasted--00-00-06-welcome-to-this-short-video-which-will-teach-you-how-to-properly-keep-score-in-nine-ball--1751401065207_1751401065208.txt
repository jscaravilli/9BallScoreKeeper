[00:00:06] welcome to this short video which will teach you how to properly keep score in nine ball on a PA league night the weekly nine ball score sheet is what you will use to keep score of all matches played after league night your score sheet will be submitted to your local APA league in whatever manner they have instructed the score sheet will ensure that both you and your opponent's members are properly ranked it's important that the score sheet be filled out neatly completely and correctly and then signed by both team captains penalties will be assessed for repeated illegible incomplete or incorrect score sheets you will notice that the nine ball score sheet has information on both sides one side contains rosters standings and next week's schedule the opposite side is where you will actually keep score on this score sheet we see that Steve Smith a skill level 5 and Joe Jones a skill level 7 have been selected to play each other their skill levels are listed here on the score sheet now let's look at how to properly fill out a score sheet after the coin toss it is decided which team must declare the first player then place that team's number in this case Steve's team in the space provided this will help you remember which team chooses first in the remaining matches for the remaining matches the teams will alternate who puts up the first player next let's look[00:01:40] at the player information section to help determine which player breaks and which player racks the balls for the first game the two players lag to lag each player takes a ball from the rack and places it behind the head string the objective is to hit the ball so that it banks off of the far rail and rolls back towards the cushion closest to the players the ball that rests closest to the cushion determines the winner of the lag the winner breaks first and is listed at the top in this example Joe won the lag so you would list Joe's team number player number his name his skill level and the points he must win listed as ball count on the score sheet now do the same for Steve to find out how many points Joe must win refer to the chart located on the opposite side of the score sheet Joe is a seven so he must score 55 points in order to win now do the same for Steve Steve is a five so he must score 38 points to win the numbers one through seventy-five above the player information are for the player listed on top circle the number that corresponds with a point total required for this player to win the numbers one through seventy-five below the player information are for the player listed on the bottom circle the number that corresponds with the point total required for this player to win in[00:03:16] this example you would circle 55 for Joe and 38 for Steve these numbers will be used to keep track of points as the shooter pockets boss a player receives one point for every ball pocketed from one through eight except for those balls pocketed when he scratches or fouls which are marked as dead balls and he receives two points for pocketing the nine ball draw a line through each number or corresponding dot as the shooter pockets balls to make the points earned visually stand out more alternate the direction of the lines for each game the first player to reach their circled number wins the match now let's look at the innings section an inning and pool is a completed cycle that gives both players a turn at the table the player who won the lag in this case Joe is listed first and represents the top half of the inning throughout the match the player who lost the lag in this case Steve represents the bottom half of the inning throughout the match since Steve lost the lag he ends each inning an inning is not over and therefore not marked until the player who lost the lag misses or foul the dead-ball section underneath the innings section is the dead-ball section[00:04:56] a dead ball is a point not credited to either player dead balls are any balls made while scratching or fouling and balls left on the table when the nine ball is made early or when a player reaches their designated ball count to win the match in the example shown here there are three balls left on the table however one of them is the nine ball which is worth two points and therefore equivalent to two dead boss dead ball should be accounted for on the score sheet to avoid confusion draw a hash mark for each dead ball during the game then total and circle the number at the end of the game to make it easier to keep a running total the score section the score sheet also has a score section for each player it is above the inning section for the player who won the lag and below the dead-ball section for the player who lost the lag at the end of each game when the 9-ball is legally pocketed or the shooting player reaches their designated ball count the score keeper should record the points each player ended with in the appropriate score section ten points should be accounted for in each game taking any dead boss into consideration the score innings and dead[00:06:35] balls for each game should be separated by a perpendicular line drawn after each game ends gameplay will bring about various other scenarios that need to be declared on the score sheet as well if a player pockets the nine ball when breaking the rack of balls at the beginning of a game it is known as a nine on the snap right 9s in the innings section for that game if a player breaks the balls and then legally pockets all of the balls in succession this is known as a break and run right BR in the inning section for that game at the end of the match total the number of nine balls pocketed on the break and the number of break and runs and write it in the appropriate block another scenario that happens frequently and needs to be written on the score sheet is when a player calls for a coaching timeout when a team takes a timeout simply mark a tee in the score section for the appropriate player the defensive shots blocked intentionally missed shots are indicated in the defensive shots block a defensive shot should be marked for a player who has no intention of actually pocketing their ball on any given shot intentionally missed shots fall into two basic categories the first category is safeties safeties are perfectly ethical but our intentional misses nevertheless[00:08:13] the second category is intentionally missed shots for the purpose of manipulating one's handicap also referred to as sandbagging by carefully marking intentionally missed shots you are not only keeping score properly you are also helping to ensure the accuracy of the skill levels of the other players in your division note the marking of a defensive shot does not affect the marking of the inning in other words the inning is marked and so is the defensive shot if appropriate accurate and conscientious scorekeeping is the team captains greatest contribution to the smooth operation of the equalizer handicap system and the prevention of sandbagging the equalizer will work perfectly if every team keeps score properly anytime a player does not attempt to pocket one of his object balls it should be marked in the players defensive shots block the only way a team can get away with manipulating the equalizer handicap system is if you let them to help you better understand though following is an example of a match where three games have been completed in the first game Joe breaks but doesn't make any balls Steve makes one ball but misses his second shot ending the inning you would now mark one inning Joe then pockets balls 2 through 9 in[00:09:55] order remember even though the game is over a second inning is not marked because the bottom player in this case Steve did not complete a second turn at the table Joe scored nine points seven points four balls two through eight and two points for the nine ball Steve scored one point one ball there were zero dead balls and there was one inning nine points for Joe plus one point for Steve plus zero dead balls equals ten total points remember ten points should be accounted for in each game in the second game Joe breaks again in this time he makes the nine ball as well as one other ball there are seven balls left on the table which will be marked as dead balls on the scoresheet Joe receives three points making his total 12 Steve receives zero points his total at one there are zero innings marked since it is still Joe shot twelve points for Joe one point for Steve and seven dead balls equals 20 total points ten points for each game[00:11:31] in the third game Joe breaks again and makes one ball then place a defensive shot passing the turn to Steve Steve then plays a defensive shot passing the turn back to Joe and ending the inning Joe makes one ball and then missus passing the turn back to Steve Steve pockets two balls and then misses ending another inning Joe place another defensive shot Steve pockets two more balls and then scratches while pocketing the next ball creating a dead ball and ending another inning Joe takes ball in hand and runs the rest of the table in this game Jo scored five points making his total 17 he also had two defensive shots Steve scored four points making his total five he had one defensive shot there was one dead ball making the dead ball total eight 17 points for Joe plus five points for Steve plus eight dead balls equals thirty points total ten points for each of the first three games the total innings block at the end of[00:13:06] the match add up all of the innings for the entire match and enter the total in the total innings block shown here the defense of shots block next add up all of the defensive shots for the entire match enter the total and circle it in the defensive shots block shown here the total points block at the end of the match add up the total points scored by each player and enter the total in the total points block the match points earned bloc in each match the players will split 20 points how those 20 points are split is determined by how well the losing player performed refer to the chart on the opposite side of the scoresheet in our example Steve's the losing player he is a skill level 5 and had 25 points therefore the match points earned by Steve is five and Joe gets 15 the least a winner can receive is 12 points and the most a winner can receive is 20 points now enter the total in the match points[00:14:48] earned block shown here at the end of the team match each team's points need to be added together and the total recorded on the total line at the bottom of the score sheet each individual match unless forfeited is worth 20 points and a team match is worth 100 points so the points earned by both teams should add up to 100 points when all five matches are played you will also need to fill in the team number after the team captain signature line then sign both score sheets now let's take a look at the fee section team captain should complete the financial section located on the opposite side of the score sheet shown here make sure you always itemize the money which is placed in the envelope with the score sheet it is very important to list the annual membership dues with the names of the members who are paying the table size section finally be sure to check the box
