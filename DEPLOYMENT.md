# Deployment Guide for 9-Ball Pool Scorer

## The Problem
When deployed to production, the app gets stuck at "setting up your match" because the in-memory storage resets when the server restarts in production environments.

## Quick Fix for Replit Deployment

### Option 1: Use Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)
1. Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit interface
2. Choose **"Autoscale"** deployment type (not Static)
3. This keeps the server running and maintains memory between requests
4. Your app will get a permanent URL like `yourapp.replit.app`

### Option 2: Add Simple Persistence
If you want to use Static deployment, you'll need to add database persistence:

1. Set up a Neon PostgreSQL database (free tier available)
2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your deployment
3. The app will automatically use database storage instead of memory

## Other Hosting Options

### Vercel (Free Tier)
- Good for static sites, but requires database for full functionality
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Custom domains available

### Netlify (Free Tier) 
- Similar to Vercel
- Great for static hosting
- Requires external database for match persistence

### Your Own Server
- Rent a VPS (Digital Ocean, Linode, AWS)
- Install Node.js and PostgreSQL
- Full control over the environment
- Requires server management skills

## Current App Status
- ✅ Fully functional in development
- ✅ All features working (scoring, undo, match completion)
- ⚠️ Production deployment needs Autoscale or database
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ APA handicap system implemented

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Use Replit's Autoscale deployment for immediate hosting
2. For long-term hosting, consider adding PostgreSQL database
3. The app is production-ready once properly deployed
