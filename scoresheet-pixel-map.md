# APA Scoresheet Scoring Area Pixel Map

## Focus Area: Scoring Grid Only
Based on user markup showing blue dots at key positions for tally placement.

## Key Observations from Markup
- Top player is lag winner (Player 1)
- Blue dots indicate precise tally positions
- Score grid spans from 1 to 75
- Numbers get circles, intermediate scores get slash marks
- Two distinct rows for Player 1 (top) and Player 2 (bottom)
